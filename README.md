# A-Secure-Multi-Tier-Web-Application-Architecture-on-AWS

The architecture ensures secure and efficient operations by maintaining a strict separation between public and private resources. It leverages key AWS services such as Amazon RDS for reliable database management, S3 with VPC endpoints for secure data storage, and ACM for SSL certification to enhance security. Amazon Route 53 is ensuring reliable domain name resolution and traffic routing. VPC peering enables seamless and secure communication across AWS regions, while a NAT Gateway in the private subnet ensures controlled internet access for updates and external communications without exposing private instances. An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) ensures efficient traffic distribution and availability. Automation is implemented using AWS Lambda and Event Bridge, enabling cost optimization by powering instances on and off during non-business hours.

This project represents a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for deploying secure web applications. The architecture is future-ready, with provisions for advanced features such as auto-scaling, ensuring it can adapt to growing business demands while maintaining optimal security and performance.
